As the codebase evolves, this guide should be updated to reflect new patterns, features, and best practices. You can use the following prompt with AI assistants like Claude to update this document:

```
Please analyze the Next.js frontend codebase and update the AI.md file to reflect any changes in:
1. Architecture or component organization
2. Data fetching patterns (React Query implementation)
3. Rendering strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR usage)
4. Authentication flows or user state management
5. New UI components or design patterns
6. Form handling or validation approaches
7. Routing structure or internationalization
8. Performance optimizations

Focus on maintaining accuracy and providing clear, concrete examples that follow the established patterns.
Pay special attention to:
- Correct usage of Server vs Client Components
- Proper query key structures
- Accurate rendering strategy recommendations
- Consistent API integration patterns
